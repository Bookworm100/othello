Debugged minimax to pass the testsuite.
Spoke with TAs to help improve the AI.
Commented most of the code.

We attempted to implement alpha-beta pruning and negamax to make
our AI stronger, but we encountered difficulties with that. Instead,
we decided to use minimax, but used 4 plies to see further down the
decision tree. Also, we used a slightly more sophisticated heuristic
for scoring each board.
